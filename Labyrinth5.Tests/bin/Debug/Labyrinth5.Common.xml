            <summary>
            Generates random maze using iterative Depth First Search algorithm. From a specified entry point
            in the matrix of MazeCell objects(initially all cells marked as walls), 
            an unvisited neigbour cell is randomly chosen, if it has only one neighbour that is a path cell - 
            that cell is made a path and pushed into the stack, otherwise the algorithms "tracks back" popping
            cells out of the stack until it reaches one that satisfies the condition.
            The process goes on until there are no cells left in the stack.
